          As of recently I've been very interested when it comes to the topic of psychedelics of the human psyche and as of 
          now I've come to the realization that if I want to be able to say that I understand myself and who I am than I 
          need to expirience everything that my brain has to offer, because how can one say they know who they truly are 
          without fully understanding what their brain is capable of.
